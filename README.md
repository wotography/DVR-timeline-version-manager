- Add or replace dates in timeline names  
- Duplicate timelines with new names
- Organize timelines into folders based on version or date
- Reformat timeline names for consistency
- Rename existing timelines

### Quick Installation

## Changelog
### v1.02 & v1.03 (2025-09-03)
- **New Features**:
  - New option to save logs to a file for easier review. Default path: "User/Documents/TimelineVersionManager/Logs". A custom path can be set.
- **Other**:
  - Improved log output: more detail and clearer messages for each operation, improved skipped-items logging, and a better final summary.
  - Bumped version number for simpler upgrade logic.
  - Fixed: The window only closed by clicking the "Close" button. Now it also closes when using the window close x.
### v0.1.12 (2025-08-31)
- **New Features**:
  - Added version format adjustment in rename mode: Automatically converts existing version formats to match the selected version format dropdown without changing the version number
  - Added date format adjustment in rename mode: Automatically converts existing date formats to match the selected date format dropdown without changing the actual date
  - Both format adjustments work independently of other checkbox settings when operation mode is set to "Rename"
- **Bug Fixes**:
  - Fixed date replacement logic: Dates now replace in their original position instead of being moved to the end
  - Improved log message clarity: "No changes needed" now shows "Skipping item" for better user feedback
- **UI Improvements**:
  - Reorganized UI layout: Moved operation mode selection to the main features section for better workflow
  - Renamed "Minus" to "Dash".
### v0.1.11 (2025-08-04)

  - Replaced complex `if/else` logic with more efficient table-driven approaches for better performance.
- **Bug Fixes**:
  - Fixed a critical bug where folder names were not created correctly when using the "Version + Date" naming scheme with certain name formatting options. The date format is now preserved.
  - Corrected an issue where timeline name formatting (e.g., converting separators to spaces) would incorrectly alter the date format within the timeline name itself.
  - Resolved an issue with the execution timer reporting incorrect durations. It now accurately measures real-world time.
